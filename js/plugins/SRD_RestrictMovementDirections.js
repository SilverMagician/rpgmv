 * Restrict Movement Directions
 * Version 1.00
 * SumRndmDde
 *
 * There are no Plugin Commands or Notetags.
 *
 * This Plugin restricts the Player from moving in a specific direction based 
 * on a Switch and/or JavaScript condition.
 *
 * This can be used to create specific scenes in which the Player should only
 * move in a certain direction, or puzzles and mazes which become difficult
 * without the Player's ability to move in every direction.
 *
 * If you have any requests or questions, feel free to ask me on my YouTube 
 * channel: http://youtube.com/c/SumRndmDde
