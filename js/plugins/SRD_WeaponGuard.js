 * Important Notes:
 * This plugin does not have any plugin commands.

 * Notetags:

 * Weapons Note Box
 * <guard_skill_id:x>
 * Set x to the Skill ID you wish to use as the Guard Skill when using 
 * this weapon.
 *
 *
 * How to Use:
 *
 * This Plugin allows you to have custom Guard Skills for your Actors based
 * on the Weapon they have equipped.
 *
 * For example, an Actor using a Giant Sword as a weapon can be given a 
 * Guard Skill that lowers his or her AGI but buffs his or her DEF by
 * also inflicting a State on them.
 *
 * Alternatively, a weapon can have a Guard Skill that is completely useless;
 * this makes it so the Weapon has no effective form of Guarding.
 *
 * Thanks for reading!
